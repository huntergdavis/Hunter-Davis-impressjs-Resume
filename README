Welcome to Hunter Davis' impress.js resume.  Most resumes are just a static list of accomplishments.  My goal with this project is to use impress.js and various open source web technologies to embed text, graphics, videos, code, etc and give a more complete picture of myself than a resume can provide.  It's also open source and BSD licensed, so have at the code and buff up your own resume.
